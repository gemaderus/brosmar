---------

This library is divided in the following sections:

1.  Reset removes all the default styles on the page to start building using 
    normalize.

2.  Generic parts that load variables, functions and mixins. Use this 
    folder for code that is applied all over the app but it is not 
    specific to a base element or an object.

3.  Helpers and useful chunks of code that do not fit in an object and 
    it is generic enough. If possible, create objects.

4.  Base elements are the building blocks of the page. Paragraphs, lists,
    images and so on.

5.  Objects refer to each individual block that builds parts of the app.

6.  Layout styles like background colors or images, usually they are refered as sections inside the dom html.

7.  Vendor is code that other Javascript libraries use and do not tend 
    to follow the OOCSS approach.
